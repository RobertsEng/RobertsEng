Here you can see an example of my recent work from a rat study investigating biomaterials for repair of volumetric muscle loss injuries, where A is a clustermap of the differential expression of over 5000 genes across 8 experimental groups, B is an UpsetR plot of the top 30 intersections of upregulated genes, and C is an UpsetR plot of the intersections of downregulated genes. UpsetR is a tool that performs a similar function as a Venn diagram, but -in my opinion- much more elegantly.

‚ö° Fun fact: Julius Caesar produced an account of his conquest of Gaul that survives to this day. I used Python's WordCloud library to generate the top 1000 words from his commentaries (translated by William Alexander McDevitte) and then superimposed the cloud onto a mask of an image of Nicolas Coustou's statue of Julius Caesar.

Caesar's ***CommentƒÅriƒ´ dƒì Bell≈ç Gallic≈ç*** -likely part of a propaganda campaign to boost his popularity with ordinary Romans- is nonetheless unique among historical documents for being a relatively detailed account of conquest produced by the conqueror themself.
