⚡ Fun fact: Julius Caesar wrote commentaries on his exploits in Gaul that survive to this day. I used Python's WordCloud library to generate the top 1000 words from his commentaries and then superimposed the cloud onto a mask of an image of Nicolas Coustou's statue of Julius Caesar. Caesar's Commentāriī dē Bellō Gallicō -likely part of a propaganda campaign to boost his popularity with ordinary Romans- is nonethless unique among historical documents for being a relatively detailed account of conquest by the conqueror.
