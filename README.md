‚ö° Fun fact: Julius Caesar produced an account of his conquest of Gaul that survives to this day. I used Python's WordCloud library to generate the top 1000 words from his commentaries (translated by William Alexander McDevitte) and then superimposed the cloud onto a mask of an image of Nicolas Coustou's statue of Julius Caesar.

Caesar's ***CommentƒÅriƒ´ dƒì Bell≈ç Gallic≈ç*** -likely part of a propaganda campaign to boost his popularity with ordinary Romans- is nonetheless unique among historical documents for being a relatively detailed account of conquest produced by the conqueror themself.
